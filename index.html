	<p>The Joker is a supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of <a id="pic5" href="#">the comic book Batman </a>(April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.</p></div>

	<div class="text">
		The DC's Dark Knight has gone up against the Man of Steel 16 times!<br> <br>
		<strong>Where Did They Happen? here are some of them:</strong> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic1">World's Finest Comics No. 143</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic1">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Oscar%20Math/worlds_finest-143-1.jpg">
		<p>An attempt at morale-boosting by Superman — which followed Batman getting hit by a bullet ricocheting off Superman's invulnerable chest — goes awry, leading to increased tensions between the superheroes. <br> <hr> Winner: N/A; the fight is broken up, and the two quickly become friends again.</p></div> <br> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic2">World's Finest Comics No. 151</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic2">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/worldsfinest151.jpg">
		<p>An "evolutionary ray" created by a long-dead scientist from Superman's homeworld malfunctions, turning Superman into a caveman and Batman into a hyper-evolved human who is, coincidentally, arrogant. Unsurprisingly, the two fight before returning to their usual selves. <br> <hr>
		Winner: Superman, apparently answering the "caveman vs. astronaut" meme decades early.</p></div> <br> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic3">World's Finest Comics No. 240</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic3">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/worldsfinest240.jpg">
		<p> Superman's actions become erratic after he's agreed to become the king of the shrunken city of Kandor. As things get worse, the Kandorians ask Batman to step in — and kill their Man of Steel. What's behind it all? Believe it or not, an evil alien cat. No, that's not a joke.

		<br><hr>
		Winner: Batman, kind of …? It's unclear; while Batman seemed to kill Superman, he actually ended up triggering a sequence of events that saved Superman's life, which was perhaps what he'd hoped for all along …?  </p></div> <br> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic4">The Dark Knight Returns No. 4</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic4">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/DarkKnightReturns3.jpg">
		<p>  With a reborn Batman causing political upheaval even as he's keeping the streets of Gotham safer than they had been in some time, the President of the United States sends in Superman to take him down. Things don't go to plan.

		<br><hr>
		Winner:  Batman, and surprisingly easily, thanks to the help of Green Arrow, some kryptonite and a mechanized suit of super-strong armor. </p></div> <br> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic5">Man of Steel No. 3</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic5">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/manofsteel3.jpg">
		<p>In a retelling of the first meeting between the two heroes, Superman is unconvinced that Batman is a good guy. The Dark Knight doesn't help his case by telling Superman that he's wired an innocent man with a bomb that will go off if the Man of Steel doesn't back off. (Spoilers: Batman is that innocent man himself.)

		<br><hr>
		Winner: Batman; even though the two never come to outright blows, Superman is still outwitted by the Caped Crusader. </p></div> <br> <hr>
		<span class="tpc" data-comicnum="comic6">Batman No. 36</span>
		<div class="comic" id="comic6">
		<img class="pic7" src="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/endgame.jpg">
		<p> Infected by Joker venom, a temporarily-insane Superman attacks Batman, leading to a massive fight that sees the Dark Knight attempt (and fail) to depower the Man of Steel via red-sun rays. Eventually, Batman manages to escape Superman after spitting kryptonite-laced polymer into his face.
		<br><hr>
		Winner: Batman, although he generously says in narration the nobody was the winner </p></div>
